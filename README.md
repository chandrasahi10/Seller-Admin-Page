The project is a web application built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be a hands-on practice platform for honing skills in these technologies. It leverages a REST API to fetch and display data dynamically, allowing me to understand the fundamentals of frontend development, interact with server-side data, and improve my proficiency in creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. Through this project, I aim to gain practical experience, solidify my knowledge, and build a foundation for more complex web development endeavors.
